## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create effective hover and active states for elements using the [:hover] and [:active] CSS pseudo-classes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.platforms p:hover,
.platforms p:active {
  font-family: "Inter-Bold";
  font-weight: 700;
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  cursor: pointer;
}

.platforms a:hover,
.platforms a:active {
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```

### Continued development

- Adding Social Media Icons
- Responsiveness for Different Devices
